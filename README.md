# groq-chat

**groq-chat** is a minimalistic, high-performance command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Groq AI and other OpenAI compartible models. Written in Go, it provides a fast, resource-efficient one-shot chat experience ideal for developers and AI enthusiasts.

- **Tiny Memory usage**: 11–14MB
- **Small Docker image size**: \~9–11MB
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS

## ⚡ Quick Overview

- **One-shot prompts only** — no conversation context is preserved.
- **Fast & lightweight** — runs even on older hardware.
- **Interactive CLI** — switch models, view history, and more.
- **Response statistics** — see token count, completion time, and tokens per second.
- **Support for multiple AI providers** — works with any OpenAI-compatible API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔑 Requirements

- **Groq API Key**: [Sign up here](https://groq.com)
- (Optional) **OpenAI API Key** if you want to use OpenAI models, also you can get xAI, OpenRouter, Mistral, etc.
- (Optional) **Go 1.18+** if building from source
- (Optional) **Docker** for containerized usage

### 📦 Installation via GitHub Releases

1. Visit [Releases](https://github.com/OleksiyM/groq-cli-chat/releases)
2. Download your platform-specific archive
3. Extract and move the binary into your `$PATH`
   ```bash
   tar -xzf groq-chat-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   mv groq-chat /usr/local/bin/
   ```

### 🐳 Run via Docker

- **Pull the latest image**
```bash
docker pull oleksiyml/groq-chat
```

- **Provide GROQ_API_KEY as an value**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -v $HOME/.groq-chat:/root/.groq-chat \
  oleksiyml/groq-chat
```

- **Provide GROQ_API_KEY as an env variable**
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key

docker run --rm -it \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=$GROQ_API_KEY \
  -v $HOME/.groq-chat:/root/.groq-chat \
  oleksiyml/groq-chat
```
See details at [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oleksiyml/groq-chat).

## 💬 Usage

```bash
groq-chat
```
After that you will see:
```txt
🍎 One-shot Groq CLI chat
[i]nfo | [m]odel | [u]pdate | [h]istory ([s]ave:%s) | [c]onfig | [q]uit

[model_name] >
```
The %s placeholder allows for dynamic display of the history saving status (On/Off).

### Interactive commands:

- `[i]` — Show current model info
- `[m]` — Switch model (up to 20 shown)
- `[u]` — Update models list from the current provider. Excluded models (part of the names) can be configured in `config_<provider>.yaml` (see below)
- `[h]` — Show history - list of the saved answers in Markdown format
- `[s]` — Toggle history saving (On/Off)
- `[c]` — Change config (it should be previously saved in `config_<provider>.yaml`)
- `[q]` — Quit

### One-shot prompts 
<details>

After receiving a response, you'll see statistics in the format:
```text
───┤ Stats: 31 tokens | 0.02 sec | 1911.78 tok/sec ├───
```

This shows:
- Total tokens used
- Completion time in seconds
- Tokens per second processing rate

- You can exclude some models from the list when updating. Each line is part of the excluded model(s) name
- You can create your own config file and use it with `[c]` command. (see below)

> **Note**: You can save all your API keys in the `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` file. 
> ```bash
> export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
> export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
> export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
> export XAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
